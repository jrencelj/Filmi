Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as \"Buffalo Bill\" (Ted Levine), who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern U.S., all young women, who are slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her, as a woman, to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, with her often having to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along, as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more dire turn when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine.

The barber is ultimately spared such persecution by Commander Schultz, whom he saved in that WWI battle. The lives of all Jews in Tomainia are eventually spared with a policy shift by Hynkel himself, who is doing so for ulterior motives. But those motives include a desire for world domination, starting with the invasion of neighboring Osterlich, which may be threatened by Benzino Napaloni, the dictator of neighboring Bacteria. Ultimately Schultz, who has turned traitor against Hynkel's regime, and the barber may be able to join forces to take control of the situation, using Schultz's inside knowledge of the regime's workings and the barber's uncanny resemblance to one of those in power.", "Language": "English, Esperanto, Latin", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Nominated for 5 Oscars. 7 wins & 6 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmExYWJjNTktNGUyZS00ODhmLTkxYzAtNWIzOGEyMGNiMmUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.4/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "92%"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "8.4", "imdbVotes": "224,374", "imdbID": "tt0032553", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "24 May 2011", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}, "The Shining": {"Title": "The Shining", "Year": "1980", "Rated": "R", "Released": "13 Jun 1980", "Runtime": "146 min", "Genre": "Drama, Horror", "Director": "Stanley Kubrick", "Writer": "Stephen King, Stanley Kubrick, Diane Johnson", "Actors": "Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd", "Plot": "Haunted by a persistent writer's block, the aspiring author and recovering alcoholic, Jack Torrance, drags his wife, Wendy, and his gifted son, Danny, up snow-capped Colorado's secluded Overlook Hotel after taking up a job as an off-season caretaker.

He is a husband to real estate agent Carolyn Burnham and father to high school student Jane Burnham. Although Lester and Carolyn once loved each other, they now merely tolerate each other. Typical wallflower Jane also hates both her parents; the three suffer individually in silence in their home life. Jane tries to steer clear of both her parents. Carolyn, relatively new to the real estate business, wants to create the persona of success to further her career, aspiring to the professional life of Buddy Kane, the king of the real estate business in their neighborhood. Lester merely walks mindlessly through life, including at his job in advertising. His company is downsizing, and he, like all the other employees, has to justify his position to the newly hired efficiency expert to keep his job. Things change for Lester when he falls in love at first sight with Jane's more experienced classmate, Angela Hayes. Both Janie and Angela can see Lester's sexual infatuation with Angela, who courts such attention from any man as a sign that she is model material, she having once appeared in Seventeen and is a career to which she aspires. Lester's infatuation with Angela gives him a reenergized view on life, where he openly doesn't care anymore what anyone thinks about what he does, anyone except Angela. This infatuation coincides with the Fittses moving in next door: homophobic disciplinarian US Marine Colonel Frank Fitts who rules the house with a military fist (that fist being both figurative and literal), his semi-comatose wife Barbara Fitts, and their bright and quietly subversive 18-year-old son Ricky Fitts, who openly abides by his father's rules while behind the scenes lives by his own quite different perspective. Much like Lester's infatuation, Ricky immediately becomes infatuated with Jane; he considers girls like Angela as ordinary. The entry of Angela and the Fittses into the Burnhams' lives ultimately leads to each of the players confronting what is truly in his or her heart.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Won 5 Oscars. 112 wins & 102 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTBmZWJkNjctNDhiNC00MGE2LWEwOTctZTk5OGVhMWMyNmVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.4/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "87%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "84/100"}], "Metascore": "84", "imdbRating": "8.4", "imdbVotes": "1,152,826", "imdbID": "tt0169547", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "02 Jan 2002", "BoxOffice": "$130,096,601", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}, "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb": {"Title": "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb", "Year": "1964", "Rated": "PG", "Released": "29 Jan 1964", "Runtime": "95 min", "Genre": "Comedy, War", "Director": "Stanley Kubrick", "Writer": "Stanley Kubrick, Terry Southern, Peter George", "Actors": "Peter Sellers, George C.

When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called \"blade runners\", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance \"retiring\" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It's now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty. One, Leon Kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon's trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell's fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael, who works as Tyrell's assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human. The problem is not only Rachael's assistance to Deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her.", "Language": "English, German, Cantonese, Japanese, Hungarian, Arabic, Korean", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Nominated for 2 Oscars. 13 wins & 19 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQzMzJhZTEtOWM4NS00MTdhLTg0YjgtMjM4MDRkZjUwZDBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.1/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "89%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "84/100"}], "Metascore": "84", "imdbRating": "8.1", "imdbVotes": "768,236", "imdbID": "tt0083658", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "30 Oct 2001", "BoxOffice": "$32,914,489", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}, "The Gold Rush": {"Title": "The Gold Rush", "Year": "1925", "Rated": "Passed", "Released": "13 Jul 1925", "Runtime": "95 min", "Genre": "Adventure, Comedy, Drama", "Director": "Charles Chaplin", "Writer": "Charles Chaplin", "Actors": "Charles Chaplin, Mack Swain, Tom Murray", "Plot": "A lone prospector ventures into Alaska looking for gold.

Paul's thought that the native population as a whole who are not directly involved in the conflict will be protected as the UN peacekeeping forces and thus the world is watching doesn't happen as the western world largely evacuates from Rwanda and abandons the natives.

Gandhi is thrown off a South African train for being an Indian and traveling in a first class compartment. Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided. It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively). It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him.", "Language": "English, Hindi", "Country": "United Kingdom, India, United States, South Africa", "Awards": "Won 8 Oscars. 35 wins & 21 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVmZGU2M2EtZTVjYy00OWU2LWI0YjEtZjQ4YjNmODhmMzhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1Njg5NTA@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.1/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "89%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "79/100"}], "Metascore": "79", "imdbRating": "8.1", "imdbVotes": "232,139", "imdbID": "tt0083987", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "20 Feb 2007", "BoxOffice": "$52,767,889", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}}
